# pytorch-intro-notebook

An introductory notebook for basic exploration of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) functionality. 

## Notebooks

Here we follow and summarise this [helpful introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-pytorch-with-an-example-a-step-by-step-tutorial-81fc5f8c4e8e) to explore some basic PyTorch operations. 

The notebooks are split into [pytorch_intro](pytorch_intro.ipynb) to work through changing from NumPy implementation to PyTorch, and [pytorch_linear_regression.ipynb] to develop a full model.
